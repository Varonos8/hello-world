Hey, I am Angelos. I like Data Analysis with Python and R. I don't wanna choose one of them because
each has its powerful advantages. The most important skill of a Data Scientist isn't to be a good Python
or R programmer or to know advance Linear Algebra and Statistics. It is the ability to learn constantly new things.
